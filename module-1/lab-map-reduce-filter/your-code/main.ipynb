       "'prophet  |almustafa, chosen the beloved, who was dawn unto his own day, had waited twelve years in city of orphalese for his ship that was to return bear him back to isle of his birth.  and in twelfth year, on seventh day of ielool, month of reaping, he climbed hill without city walls and looked seaward; he beheld his ship coming with mist.  then gates of his heart were flung open, his joy flew far over sea. and he closed his eyes prayed in the silences of his soul.  *****  but as he descended hill, sadness came upon him, he thought in his heart:  how shall i go in peace without sorrow? nay, not without wound in the spirit shall i leave this city. long were days of pain i have spent within its walls, long were the nights of aloneness; who can depart from his pain his aloneness without regret?  too many fragments of spirit have i scattered in these streets, too many are children of my longing that walk naked among these hills, i cannot withdraw from them without burden and an ache.  it is not garment i cast off this day, but skin that i tear with my own hands.  nor is it thought i leave behind me, but heart made sweet with hunger and with thirst.  *****  yet i cannot tarry longer.  the sea that calls all things unto her calls me, i must embark.  for to stay, though hours burn in the night, is to freeze crystallize and be bound in mould.  fain would i take with me all that is here. but how shall i?  a voice cannot carry tongue and the lips that gave it wings. alone must it seek ether.  and alone without his nest shall the eagle fly across sun.  *****  now when he reached foot of the hill, he turned again towards sea, and he saw his ship approaching the harbour, upon her prow mariners, the men of his own land.  and his soul cried out to them, he said:  sons of my ancient mother, you riders of the tides,  how often have you sailed in my dreams. and now you come in my awakening, which is my deeper dream.  ready am i to go, my eagerness with sails full set awaits wind.  only another breath will i breathe in this still air, only another loving look cast backward,  and then i shall stand among you, a seafarer among seafarers. you, vast sea, sleepless mother,  who alone are peace freedom to the river stream,  only another winding will this stream make, only another murmur in this glade,  and then shall i come to you, a boundless drop to boundless ocean.  *****  and as he walked he saw from afar men and women leaving their fields their vineyards hastening towards city gates.  and he heard their voices calling his name, shouting from field to field telling one another of coming of his ship.  and he said to himself:  shall day of parting be day of gathering?  and shall it be said that my eve was in truth my dawn?  and what shall i give unto him who has left his plough in midfurrow, or to him who has stopped wheel of his winepress? shall my heart become a tree heavy-laden with fruit that i may gather give unto them?  and shall my desires flow like a fountain that i may fill their cups?  am i harp that hand of mighty may touch me, or flute that his breath may pass through me?  a seeker of silences am i, what treasure have i found in silences that i may dispense with confidence?  if this is my day of harvest, in what fields have i sowed seed, in what unremembered seasons?  if this indeed be hour in which i lift up my lantern, it is not my flame that shall burn therein.  empty dark shall i raise my lantern,  and guardian of night shall fill it with oil he shall light it also.  *****  these things he said in words. but much in his heart remained unsaid. for he himself could not speak his deeper secret.  *****  [illustration: 0020]  and when he entered into city all the people came to meet him, they were crying out to him as with one voice.  and elders of city stood forth and said:  go not yet away from us.  a noontide have you been in our twilight, your youth has given us dreams to dream.  no stranger are you among us, nor a guest, but our son our dearly beloved.  suffer not yet our eyes to hunger for your face.  *****  and priests priestesses said unto him:  let not waves of sea separate us now, years you have spent in our midst become memory.  you have walked among us spirit, and your shadow has been light upon our faces.  much have we loved you. but speechless was our love, with veils has it been veiled.  yet now it cries aloud unto you, and would stand revealed before you.  and ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until hour of separation.  *****  and others came also entreated him. but he answered them not. he only bent his head; those who stood near saw his tears falling upon his breast.  and he people proceeded towards the great square before temple.  and there came out of sanctuary a woman whose name was almitra. she was seeress.  and he looked upon her with exceeding tenderness, for it was she who had first sought believed in him when he had been but day in their city. and she hailed him, saying:  prophet of god, in quest of the uttermost, long have you searched the distances for your ship.  and now your ship has come, you must needs go.  deep is your longing for land of your memories dwelling place of your greater desires; our love would not bind you nor our needs hold you.  yet this we ask ere you leave us, that you speak to us give us of your truth.  and we will give it unto our children, and they unto their children, it shall not perish.  in your aloneness you have watched with our days, in your wakefulness you have listened to weeping the laughter of our sleep.  now therefore disclose us to ourselves, and tell us all that has been shown you of that which is between birth and death.  *****  and he answered,  people of orphalese, of what can i speak save of that which is even now moving within your souls?  ***** *****  then said almitra, speak to us of _love_.  and he raised his head looked upon the people, there fell stillness upon them. with great voice he said:  when love beckons to you, follow him,  though his ways are hard steep.  and when his wings enfold you yield to him,  though sword hidden among his pinions may wound you.  and when he speaks to you believe in him,  though his voice may shatter your dreams as north wind lays waste garden.  for even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning.  even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in sun,  so shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth.  *****  like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto himself.  he threshes you to make you naked.  he sifts you to free you from your husks.  he grinds you to whiteness.  he kneads you until you are pliant;  and then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you may become sacred bread for god’s sacred feast.  *****  all these things shall love do unto you that you may know secrets of your heart, in that knowledge become a fragment of life’s heart.  but if in your fear you would seek only love’s peace love’s pleasure,  then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness pass out of love’s threshing-floor,  into seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, weep, but not all of your tears.  *****  love gives naught but itself takes naught but from itself.  love possesses not nor would it be possessed;  for love is sufficient unto love.  when you love you should not say, “god is in my heart,” but rather, “i am in the heart of god.”  and think not you can direct course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.  love has no other desire but to fulfil itself.  but if you love must needs have desires, let these be your desires:  to melt be like running brook that sings its melody to night. to know pain of too much tenderness.  to be wounded by your own understanding of love;  and to bleed willingly joyfully.  to wake at dawn with winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving;  to rest at noon hour meditate love’s ecstacy;  to return home at eventide with gratitude;  and then to sleep with prayer for the beloved in your heart song of praise upon your lips.  [illustration: 0029]  ***** *****  then almitra spoke again said, and what of _marriage_ master?  and he answered saying:  you were born together, together you shall be forevermore.  you shall be together when white wings of death scatter your days.  aye, you shall be together even in the silent memory of god.  but let there be spaces in your togetherness,  and let winds of heavens dance between you.  *****  love one another, but make not bond of love:  let it rather be moving sea between the shores of your souls.  fill each other’s cup but drink not from one cup.  give one another of your bread but eat not from same loaf. sing and dance together be joyous, but let each one of you be alone,  even as strings of lute are alone though they quiver with same music.  *****  give your hearts, but not into each other’s keeping.  for only hand of life can contain your hearts.  and stand together yet not too near together:  for pillars of temple stand apart,  and oak tree cypress grow not in each other’s shadow.  [illustration: 0032]  ***** *****  and woman who held babe against her bosom said, speak to us of _children_.  and he said:  your children are not your children.  they are sons daughters of life’s longing for itself.  they come through you but not from you,  and though they are with you yet they belong not to you.  *****  you may give them your love but not your thoughts,  for they have their own thoughts.  you may house their bodies but not their souls,  for their souls dwell in house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.  you may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you. for life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.  you are bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.  the archer sees mark upon path of infinite, he bends you with his might that his arrows may go swift and far.  let your bending in archer’s hand be for gladness;  for even as he loves arrow that flies, so he loves also bow that is stable.  ***** *****  then said rich man, speak to us of _giving_.  and he answered:  you give but little when you give of your possessions.  it is when you give of yourself that you truly give.  for what are your possessions but things you keep guard for fear you may need them tomorrow?  and tomorrow, what shall tomorrow bring to overprudent dog burying bones in trackless sand as he follows the pilgrims to holy city?  and what is fear of need but need itself?  is not dread of thirst when your well is full, thirst that is unquenchable?  there are those who give little of the much which they have--and they give it for recognition their hidden desire makes their gifts unwholesome.  and there are those who have little and give it all.  these are believers in life and the bounty of life, their coffer is never empty.  there are those who give with joy, and that joy is their reward.  and there are those who give with pain, and that pain is their baptism.  and there are those who give know not pain in giving, nor do they seek joy, nor give with mindfulness of virtue;  they give as in yonder valley myrtle breathes its fragrance into space.  through hands of such as these god speaks, from behind their eyes he smiles upon earth.  [illustration: 0039]  it is well to give when asked, but it is better to give unasked, through understanding;  and to open-handed search for one who shall receive is joy greater than giving.  and is there aught you would withhold?  all you have shall some day be given;  therefore give now, that season of giving may be yours not your inheritors’.  you often say, “i would give, but only to deserving.”  the trees in your orchard say not so, nor flocks in your pasture.  they give that they may live, for to withhold is to perish.  surely he who is worthy to receive his days his nights, is worthy of all else from you.  and he who has deserved to drink from the ocean of life deserves to fill his cup from your little stream.  and what desert greater shall there be, than that which lies in courage and confidence, nay charity, of receiving?  and who are you that men should rend their bosom unveil their pride, that you may see their worth naked and their pride unabashed?  see first that you yourself deserve to be giver, instrument of giving.  for in truth it is life that gives unto life--while you, who deem yourself a giver, are but witness.  and you receivers--and you are all receivers--assume no weight of gratitude, lest you lay yoke upon yourself upon him who gives.  rather rise together with giver on his gifts as on wings;  for to be overmindful of your debt, is ito doubt his generosity who has the freehearted earth for mother, god for father.  [illustration: 0042]  ***** *****  then old man, keeper of an inn, said, speak to us of _eating and drinking_.  and he said:  would that you could live on the fragrance of earth, like air plant be sustained by light.  but since you must kill to eat, rob the newly born of its mother’s milk to quench your thirst, let it then be an act of worship,  and let your board stand altar on which pure innocent of forest plain are sacrificed for that which is purer still more innocent in man.  *****  when you kill beast say to him in your heart,  “by same power that slays you, i too am slain; i too shall be consumed. for law that delivered you into my hand shall deliver me into mightier hand.  your blood my blood is naught but the sap that feeds tree of heaven.”  *****  and when you crush apple with your teeth, say to it in your heart,  “your seeds shall live in my body,  and buds of your tomorrow shall blossom in my heart,  and your fragrance shall be my breath, and together we shall rejoice through all seasons.”  *****  and in autumn, when you gather the grapes of your vineyards for the winepress, say in your heart,  “i too am vineyard, my fruit shall be gathered for winepress,  and like new wine i shall be kept in eternal vessels.”  and in winter, when you draw wine, let there be in your heart song for each cup;  and let there be in song a remembrance for autumn days, for the vineyard, for winepress.  ***** *****   then ploughman said, speak to us of _work_.  and he answered, saying:  you work that you may keep pace with the earth soul of earth.  for to be idle is to become stranger unto seasons, to step out of life’s procession, that marches in majesty proud submission towards the infinite.  when you work you are flute through whose heart whispering of hours turns to music.  which of you would be reed, dumb and silent, when all else sings together in unison?  always you have been told that work is a curse labour misfortune.  but i say to you that when you work you fulfil part of earth’s furthest dream, assigned to you when that dream was born,  and in keeping yourself with labour you are in truth loving life,  and to love life through labour is to be intimate with life’s inmost secret.  *****  but if you in your pain call birth an affliction support of flesh a curse written upon your brow, then i answer that naught but sweat of your brow shall wash away that which is written.  you have been told also that life is darkness, in your weariness you echo what was said by weary.  and i say that life is indeed darkness ‘save when there is urge,  and all urge is blind save when there is knowledge,  and all knowledge is vain save when there is work,  and all work is empty save when there is love;  and when you work with love you bind yourself to yourself, to one another, to god.  *****  and what is it to work with love?  it is to weave cloth with threads drawn from your heart, even as if your beloved were to wear that cloth.  it is to build house with affection, even as if your beloved were to dwell in that house.  it is to sow seeds with tenderness and reap harvest with joy, even as if your beloved were to eat fruit.  it is to charge all things you fashion with breath of your own spirit,  and to know that all blessed dead are standing about you watching.  often have i heard you say, as if speaking in sleep, “he who works in marble, finds shape of his own soul in stone, is nobler than he who ploughs soil. he who seizes the rainbow to lay it on cloth in the likeness of man, is more than he who makes sandals for our feet.”  but i say, not in sleep but in the overwakefulness of noontide, that the wind speaks not more sweetly to the giant oaks than to least of all the blades of grass;  and he alone is great who turns the voice of wind into song made sweeter by his own loving.  *****  work is love made visible.  and if you cannot work with love but only with distaste, it is better that you should leave your work sit at the gate of temple take alms of those who work with joy.  for if you bake bread with indifference, you bake bitter bread that feeds but half man’s hunger.  and if you grudge crushing of the grapes, your grudge distils poison in the wine. if you sing though as angels, love not singing, you muffle man’s ears to voices of the day voices of night.  ***** *****  then woman said, speak to us of _joy sorrow_.  and he answered:  your joy is your sorrow unmasked.  and selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears.  and how else can it be?  the deeper that sorrow carves into your being, more joy you can contain.  is not cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in potter’s oven?  and is not lute that soothes your spirit, very wood that was hollowed with knives?  when you are joyous, look deep into your heart you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy.  when you are sorrowful look again in your heart, you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.  *****  some of you say, “joy is greater than sorrow,” others say, “nay, sorrow is the greater.”  but i say unto you, they are inseparable.  together they come, when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that other is asleep upon your bed.  verily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow your joy.  only when you are empty are you at standstill balanced.  when treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold his silver, needs must your joy or your sorrow rise or fall.  ***** *****  then mason came forth said, speak to us of _houses_.  and he answered said:  build of your imaginings bower in the wilderness ere you build house within the city walls.  for even as you have home-comings in your twilight, so has wanderer in you, ever distant alone.  your house is your larger body.  it grows in sun sleeps in the stillness of night; it is not dreamless. does not your house dream? and dreaming, leave city for grove or hilltop?  would that i could gather your houses into my hand, like sower scatter them in forest meadow.  would valleys were your streets, and the green paths your alleys, that you might seek one another through vineyards, come with fragrance of earth in your garments.  but these things are not yet to be.  in their fear your forefathers gathered you too near together. that fear shall endure little longer. little longer shall your city walls separate your hearths from your fields.  *****  and tell me, people of orphalese, what have you in these houses? what is it you guard with fastened doors?  have you peace, quiet urge that reveals your power?  have you remembrances, glimmering arches that span summits of the mind?  have you beauty, that leads heart from things fashioned of wood stone to holy mountain?  tell me, have you these in your houses?  or have you only comfort, lust for comfort, that stealthy thing that enters house guest, then becomes host, then master?  *****  ay, it becomes tamer, with hook scourge makes puppets of your larger desires.  though its hands are silken, its heart is of iron.  it lulls you to sleep only to stand by your bed jeer at dignity of the flesh.  it makes mock of your sound senses, and lays them in thistledown like fragile vessels.  verily lust for comfort murders the passion of soul, then walks grinning in funeral.  but you, children of space, you restless in rest, you shall not be trapped nor tamed.  your house shall be not anchor but a mast.  it shall not be glistening film that covers wound, but eyelid that guards eye.  you shall not fold your wings that you may pass through doors, nor bend your heads that they strike not against a ceiling, nor fear to breathe lest walls should crack fall down.  you shall not dwell in tombs made by the dead for living.  and though of magnificence and splendour, your house shall not hold your secret nor shelter your longing.  for that which is boundless in you abides in mansion of sky, whose door is morning mist, whose windows are songs silences of night.  ***** *****  and weaver said, speak to us of _clothes_.  and he answered:  your clothes conceal much of your beauty, yet they hide not the unbeautiful.  and though you seek in garments the freedom of privacy you may find in them a harness chain.  would that you could meet sun and the wind with more of your skin less of your raiment,  for breath of life is in the sunlight hand of life is in the wind.  some of you say, “it is north wind who has woven clothes we wear.”  and i say, ay, it was north wind,  but shame was his loom, the softening of sinews was his thread.  and when his work was done he laughed in the forest. forget not that modesty is for shield against eye of the unclean.  and when unclean shall be no more, what were modesty but fetter a fouling of mind?  and forget not that earth delights to feel your bare feet winds long to play with your hair.  ***** *****  and merchant said, speak to us of _buying selling_.  and he answered said:  to you earth yields her fruit, and you shall not want if you but know how to fill your hands.  it is in exchanging gifts of the earth that you shall find abundance and be satisfied.  yet unless exchange be in love and kindly justice, it will but lead some to greed others to hunger.  when in market place you toilers of the sea fields vineyards meet the weavers potters the gatherers of spices,--  invoke then master spirit of the earth, to come into your midst and sanctify scales reckoning that weighs value against value. and suffer not barren-handed to take part in your transactions, who would sell their words for your labour.  to such men you should say,  “come with us to field, or go with our brothers to sea cast your net;  for land sea shall be bountiful to you even as to us.”  *****  and if there come singers the dancers flute players,--buy of their gifts also.  for they too are gatherers of fruit and frankincense, that which they bring, though fashioned of dreams, is raiment and food for your soul.  and before you leave market place, see that no one has gone his way with empty hands.  for master spirit of earth shall not sleep peacefully upon wind till needs of least of you are satisfied.  ***** *****  then one of judges of city stood forth said, speak to us of _crime punishment_.  and he answered, saying:  it is when your spirit goes wandering upon wind,  that you, alone unguarded, commit a wrong unto others therefore unto yourself.  and for that wrong committed must you knock wait while unheeded at the gate of blessed.  like ocean is your god-self;  it remains for ever undefiled.  and like ether it lifts but the winged.  even like sun is your god-self;  it knows not ways of mole nor seeks it holes of serpent. but your god-self dwells not alone in your being.  much in you is still man, much in you is not yet man,  but shapeless pigmy that walks asleep in mist searching for its own awakening.  and of man in you would i now speak.  for it is he not your god-self nor the pigmy in mist, that knows crime and punishment of crime.  *****  oftentimes have i heard you speak of one who commits wrong as though he were not one of you, but stranger unto you and intruder upon your world.  but i say that even as holy the righteous cannot rise beyond highest which is in each one of you,  so wicked weak cannot fall lower than lowest which is in you also.  and as single leaf turns not yellow but with silent knowledge of the whole tree, so wrong-doer cannot do wrong without hidden will of you all.  like procession you walk together towards your god-self.  [illustration: 0064]  you are way wayfarers.  and when one of you falls down he falls for those behind him, caution against the stumbling stone.  ay, he falls for those ahead of him, who though faster surer of foot, yet removed not stumbling stone.  and this also, though word lie heavy upon your hearts:  the murdered is not unaccountable for his own murder,  and robbed is not blameless in being robbed.  the righteous is not innocent of the deeds of wicked,  and white-handed is not clean in the doings of felon.  yea, guilty is oftentimes victim of injured,  and still more often condemned is the burden bearer for guiltless and unblamed.  you cannot separate just from the unjust good from wicked;  for they stand together before face of sun even as black thread and the white are woven together.  and when black thread breaks, the weaver shall look into whole cloth, and he shall examine loom also.  *****  if any of you would bring to judgment the unfaithful wife,  let him also weigh heart of her husband in scales, measure his soul with measurements.  and let him who would lash offender look unto spirit of offended.  and if any of you would punish in the name of righteousness lay ax unto evil tree, let him see to its roots;  and verily he will find roots of the good bad, fruitful the fruitless, all entwined together in the silent heart of earth.  and you judges who would be just,  what judgment pronounce you upon him who though honest in flesh yet is a thief in spirit?  what penalty lay you upon him who slays in flesh yet is himself slain in the spirit?  and how prosecute you him who in action is deceiver oppressor,  yet who also is aggrieved outraged?  *****  and how shall you punish those whose remorse is already greater than their misdeeds?  is not remorse justice which is administered by that very law which you would fain serve?  yet you cannot lay remorse upon the innocent nor lift it from heart of the guilty.  unbidden shall it call in night, that men may wake gaze upon themselves. you who would understand justice, how shall you unless you look upon all deeds in fullness of light?  only then shall you know that erect and fallen are but one man standing in twilight between night of his pigmy-self day of his god-self, and that corner-stone of temple is not higher than lowest stone in its foundation.  ***** *****  then lawyer said, but what of our _laws_, master?  and he answered:  you delight in laying down laws,  yet you delight more in breaking them.  like children playing by ocean who build sand-towers with constancy and then destroy them with laughter.  but while you build your sand-towers the ocean brings more sand to shore,  and when you destroy them ocean laughs with you.  verily ocean laughs always with the innocent.  but what of those to whom life is not an ocean, man-made laws are not sand-towers,  but to whom life is rock, law a chisel with which they would carve it in their own likeness? what of the cripple who hates dancers?  what of ox who loves his yoke and deems elk deer of forest stray vagrant things?  what of old serpent who cannot shed his skin, calls all others naked and shameless?  and of him who comes early to the wedding-feast, when over-fed and tired goes his way saying that all feasts are violation all feasters lawbreakers?  *****  what shall i say of these save that they too stand in sunlight, but with their backs to sun?  they see only their shadows, their shadows are their laws.  and what is sun to them but caster of shadows?  and what is it to acknowledge the laws but to stoop down trace their shadows upon earth?  but you who walk facing sun, what images drawn on earth can hold you?  you who travel with wind, what weather-vane shall direct your course?  what man’s law shall bind you if you break your yoke but upon no man’s prison door?  what laws shall you fear if you dance but stumble against no man’s iron chains?  and who is he that shall bring you to judgment if you tear off your garment yet leave it in no man’s path?  *****  people of orphalese, you can muffle the drum, you can loosen strings of lyre, but who shall command the skylark not to sing?  ***** *****  and orator said, speak to us of _freedom_.  and he answered:  at city gate by your fireside i have seen you prostrate yourself and worship your own freedom,  even as slaves humble themselves before a tyrant praise him though he slays them.  ay, in grove of temple in the shadow of citadel i have seen the freest among you wear their freedom as yoke handcuff.  and my heart bled within me; for you can only be free when even desire of seeking freedom becomes harness to you, when you cease to speak of freedom as goal fulfilment.  you shall be free indeed when your days are not without care nor your nights without want grief,  but rather when these things girdle your life yet you rise above them naked and unbound.  *****  and how shall you rise beyond your days and nights unless you break the chains which you at dawn of your understanding have fastened around your noon hour?  in truth that which you call freedom is the strongest of these chains, though its links glitter in sun dazzle your eyes.  and what is it but fragments of your own self you would discard that you may become free?  if it is unjust law you would abolish, that law was written with your own hand upon your own forehead.  you cannot erase it by burning your law books nor by washing foreheads of your judges, though you pour sea upon them.  and if it is despot you would dethrone, see first that his throne erected within you is destroyed.  for how can tyrant rule free and the proud, but for tyranny in their own freedom shame in their own pride?  and if it is care you would cast off, that cart has been chosen by you rather than imposed upon you.  and if it is fear you would dispel, the seat of that fear is in your heart and not in hand of feared.  *****  verily all things move within your being in constant half embrace, desired and dreaded, repugnant the cherished, pursued that which you would escape.  these things move within you as lights and shadows in pairs that cling.  and when shadow fades is no more, light that lingers becomes a shadow to another light.  and thus your freedom when it loses its fetters becomes itself fetter of a greater freedom.  ***** *****  and priestess spoke again and said: speak to us of _reason and passion_.  and he answered, saying:  your soul is oftentimes battlefield, upon which your reason your judgment wage war against your passion your appetite.  would that i could be peacemaker in your soul, that i might turn discord and rivalry of your elements into oneness melody.  but how shall i, unless you yourselves be also peacemakers, nay, lovers of all your elements?  your reason your passion are the rudder sails of your seafaring soul.  if either your sails or your rudder be broken, you can but toss drift, or else be held at standstill in mid-seas. for reason, ruling alone, is force confining; passion, unattended, is flame that burns to its own destruction.  therefore let your soul exalt your reason to height of passion, that it may sing;  and let it direct your passion with reason, that your passion may live through its own daily resurrection, and like phoenix rise above its own ashes.  *****  i would have you consider your judgment and your appetite even as you would two loved guests in your house.  surely you would not honour one guest above other; for he who is more mindful of one loses love the faith of both  among hills, when you sit in the cool shade of white poplars, sharing the peace serenity of distant fields and meadows--then let your heart say in silence, “god rests in reason.”  and when storm comes, the mighty wind shakes forest, and thunder lightning proclaim the majesty of sky,--then let your heart say in awe, “god moves in passion.”  and since you are breath in god’s sphere, leaf in god’s forest, you too should rest in reason move in passion.  ***** *****  and woman spoke, saying, tell us of _pain_.  and he said:  your pain is breaking of shell that encloses your understanding.  even as stone of fruit must break, that its heart may stand in the sun, so must you know pain.  and could you keep your heart in wonder at daily miracles of your life, your pain would not seem less wondrous than your joy;  and you would accept seasons of your heart, even as you have always accepted the seasons that pass over your fields.  and you would watch with serenity through winters of your grief.  much of your pain is self-chosen.  it is bitter potion by which the physician within you heals your sick self.  therefore trust physician, drink his remedy in silence tranquillity: for his hand, though heavy hard, is guided by tender hand of unseen, and cup he brings, though it burn your lips, has been fashioned of the clay which potter has moistened with his own sacred tears.  ***** *****  and man said, speak to us of _self-knowledge_.  and he answered, saying:  your hearts know in silence secrets of days nights.  but your ears thirst for sound of your heart’s knowledge.  you would know in words that which you have always known in thought.  you would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dreams.  and it is well you should.  the hidden well-spring of your soul must needs rise run murmuring to sea;  and treasure of your infinite depths would be revealed to your eyes.  but let there be no scales to weigh your unknown treasure;  and seek not depths of your knowledge with staff or sounding line.  for self is sea boundless and measureless.  *****  say not, “i have found truth,” but rather, “i have found truth.”  say not, “i have found path of the soul.” say rather, “i have met soul walking upon my path.”  for soul walks upon all paths.  the soul walks not upon line, neither does it grow like reed.  the soul unfolds itself, like lotus of countless petals.  [illustration: 0083]  ***** *****  then said teacher, speak to us of _teaching_.  and he said:  “no man can reveal to you aught but that which already lies half asleep in the dawning of your knowledge.  the teacher who walks in shadow of the temple, among his followers, gives not of his wisdom but rather of his faith his lovingness.  if he is indeed wise he does not bid you enter house of his wisdom, but rather leads you to threshold of your own mind.  the astronomer may speak to you of his understanding of space, but he cannot give you his understanding.  the musician may sing to you of the rhythm which is in all space, but he cannot give you ear which arrests the rhythm nor voice that echoes it. and he who is versed in science of numbers can tell of regions of weight measure, but he cannot conduct you thither.  for vision of one man lends not its wings to another man.  and even as each one of you stands alone in god’s knowledge, so must each one of you be alone in his knowledge of god and in his understanding of earth.  ***** *****  and youth said, speak to us of _friendship_.  and he answered, saying:  your friend is your needs answered.  he is your field which you sow with love and reap with thanksgiving.  and he is your board your fireside.  for you come to him with your hunger, and you seek him for peace.  when your friend speaks his mind you fear not “nay” in your own mind, nor do you withhold “ay.”  and when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;  for without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.  when you part from your friend, you grieve not;  for that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to climber is clearer from plain. let there be no purpose in friendship save deepening of spirit.  for love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but net cast forth: only the unprofitable is caught.  *****  and let your best be for your friend.  if he must know ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.  for what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?  seek him always with hours to live.  for it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.  and in sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, sharing of pleasures.  for in dew of little things the heart finds its morning is refreshed.  ***** *****  and then scholar said, speak of _talking_.  and he answered, saying:  you talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts;  and when you can no longer dwell in the solitude of your heart you live in your lips, sound is diversion a pastime.  and in much of your talking, thinking is half murdered.  for thought is bird of space, that in a cage of words may indeed unfold its wings but cannot fly.  there are those among you who seek the talkative through fear of being alone.  the silence of aloneness reveals to their eyes their naked selves they would escape.  and there are those who talk, and without knowledge or forethought reveal a truth which they themselves do not understand.  and there are those who have truth within them, but they tell it not in words.  in bosom of such as these spirit dwells in rhythmic silence.  *****  when you meet your friend on the roadside or in market place, let the spirit in you move your lips direct your tongue.  let voice within your voice speak to the ear of his ear;  for his soul will keep truth of your heart as taste of wine is remembered  when colour is forgotten the vessel is no more.  ***** *****  and astronomer said, master, what of _time_?  and he answered:  you would measure time measureless and immeasurable.  you would adjust your conduct and even direct course of your spirit according to hours seasons.  of time you would make stream upon whose bank you would sit watch its flowing.  yet timeless in you is aware of life’s timelessness,  and knows that yesterday is but today’s memory tomorrow is today’s dream.  and that that which sings and contemplates in you is still dwelling within bounds of that first moment which scattered stars into space. who among you does not feel that his power to love is boundless?  and yet who does not feel that very love, though boundless, encompassed within centre of his being, and moving not from love thought to love thought, nor from love deeds to other love deeds?  and is not time even as love is, undivided paceless?  *****  but if in your thought you must measure time into seasons, let each season encircle all other seasons,  and let today embrace past with remembrance future with longing.  ***** *****  and one of elders of city said, speak to us of _good evil_.  and he answered:  of good in you i can speak, but not of evil.  for what is evil but good tortured by its own hunger thirst?  verily when good is hungry it seeks food even in dark caves, when it thirsts it drinks even of dead waters.  you are good when you are one with yourself.  yet when you are not one with yourself you are not evil.  for divided house is not den of thieves; it is only divided house.  and ship without rudder may wander aimlessly among perilous isles yet sink not to bottom. you are good when you strive to give of yourself.  yet you are not evil when you seek gain for yourself.  for when you strive for gain you are but root that clings to earth and sucks at her breast.  surely fruit cannot say to root, “be like me, ripe full ever giving of your abundance.”  for to fruit giving is need, as receiving is need to root.  *****  you are good when you are fully awake in your speech,  yet you are not evil when you sleep while your tongue staggers without purpose.  and even stumbling speech may strengthen a weak tongue.  you are good when you walk to your goal firmly with bold steps.  yet you are not evil when you go thither limping. even those who limp go not backward.  but you who are strong swift, see that you do not limp before lame, deeming it kindness.  *****  you are good in countless ways, you are not evil when you are not good,  you are only loitering sluggard.  pity that stags cannot teach swiftness to turtles.  in your longing for your giant self lies your goodness: that longing is in all of you.  but in some of you that longing is a torrent rushing with might to sea, carrying secrets of hillsides and songs of forest.  and in others it is flat stream that loses itself in angles bends and lingers before it reaches shore.  but let not him who longs much say to him who longs little, “wherefore are you slow halting?”  for truly good ask not naked, “where is your garment?” nor the houseless, “what has befallen your house?”  ***** *****  then priestess said, speak to us of _prayer_.  and he answered, saying:  you pray in your distress in your need; would that you might pray also in fullness of your joy in your days of abundance.  for what is prayer but expansion of yourself into living ether?  and if it is for your comfort to pour your darkness into space, it is also for your delight to pour forth dawning of your heart.  and if you cannot but weep when your soul summons you to prayer, she should spur you again yet again, though weeping, until you shall come laughing.  when you pray you rise to meet in the air those who are praying at that very hour, whom save in prayer you may not meet.  therefore let your visit to that temple invisible be for naught but ecstasy and sweet communion.  for if you should enter temple for no other purpose than asking you shall not receive:  and if you should enter into it to humble yourself you shall not be lifted:  or even if you should enter into it to beg for good of others you shall not be heard.  it is enough that you enter temple invisible.  *****  i cannot teach you how to pray in words.  god listens not to your words save when he himself utters them through your lips.  and i cannot teach you prayer of the seas forests mountains. but you who are born of the mountains forests seas can find their prayer in your heart,  and if you but listen in stillness of night you shall hear them saying in silence,  “our god, who art our winged self, it is thy will in us that willeth.  it is thy desire in us that desireth.  it is thy urge in us that would turn our nights, which are thine, into days which are thine also.  we cannot ask thee for aught, for thou knowest our needs before they are born in us:  thou art our need; in giving us more of thyself thou givest us all.”  [illustration: 0100]  ***** *****  then hermit, who visited city once year, came forth said, speak to us of _pleasure_.  and he answered, saying:  pleasure is freedom-song,  but it is not freedom.  it is blossoming of your desires,  but it is not their fruit.  it is depth calling unto height,  but it is not deep nor high.  it is caged taking wing,  but it is not space encompassed.  ay, in very truth, pleasure is a freedom-song.  and i fain would have you sing it with fullness of heart; yet i would not have you lose your hearts in singing.  some of your youth seek pleasure as if it were all, they are judged and rebuked. i would not judge nor rebuke them. i would have them seek.  for they shall find pleasure, but not her alone;  seven are her sisters, least of them is more beautiful than pleasure.  have you not heard of man who was digging in earth for roots found a treasure?  *****  and some of your elders remember pleasures with regret like wrongs committed in drunkenness.  but regret is beclouding of mind and not its chastisement.  they should remember their pleasures with gratitude, as they would the harvest of summer.  yet if it comforts them to regret, let them be comforted.  and there are among you those who are neither young to seek nor old to remember;  and in their fear of seeking and remembering they shun all pleasures, lest they neglect spirit or offend against it.  but even in their foregoing is their pleasure.  and thus they too find treasure though they dig for roots with quivering hands.  but tell me, who is he that can offend the spirit?  shall nightingale offend the stillness of night, or firefly the stars?  and shall your flame or your smoke burden wind?  think you spirit is still pool which you can trouble with staff?  *****  oftentimes in denying yourself pleasure you do but store desire in the recesses of your being.  who knows but that which seems omitted today, waits for tomorrow?  even your body knows its heritage and its rightful need will not be deceived.  and your body is harp of your soul,  and it is yours to bring forth sweet music from it or confused sounds.  *****  and now you ask in your heart, “how shall we distinguish that which is good in pleasure from that which is not good?”  go to your fields your gardens, and you shall learn that it is pleasure of bee to gather honey of the flower,  but it is also pleasure of the flower to yield its honey to bee.  for to bee flower is fountain of life,  and to flower bee is messenger of love,  and to both, bee flower, giving and receiving of pleasure is need and ecstasy.  people of orphalese, be in your pleasures like flowers bees.  ***** *****  and poet said, speak to us of _beauty_.  and he answered:  where shall you seek beauty, how shall you find her unless she herself be your way your guide?  and how shall you speak of her except she be weaver of your speech?  the aggrieved injured say, “beauty is kind gentle.  like young mother half-shy of her own glory she walks among us.”  and passionate say, “nay, beauty is a thing of might dread.  like tempest she shakes earth beneath us sky above us.”  the tired weary say, “beauty is of soft whisperings. she speaks in our spirit. her voice yields to our silences like faint light that quivers in fear of shadow.”  but restless say, “we have heard her shouting among mountains,  and with her cries came sound of hoofs, beating of wings the roaring of lions.”  at night watchmen of city say, “beauty shall rise with dawn from the east.”  and at noontide toilers the wayfarers say, “we have seen her leaning over earth from windows of the sunset.”  *****  in winter say snow-bound, “she shall come with spring leaping upon the hills.”  and in summer heat reapers say, “we have seen her dancing with the autumn leaves, we saw drift of snow in her hair.” all these things have you said of beauty,  yet in truth you spoke not of her but of needs unsatisfied,  and beauty is not need but ecstasy.  it is not mouth thirsting nor empty hand stretched forth,  but rather heart enflamed soul enchanted.  it is not image you would see nor the song you would hear,  but rather image you see though you close your eyes song you hear though you shut your ears.  it is not sap within furrowed bark, nor wing attached to claw,  but rather garden for ever in bloom and flock of angels for ever in flight.  *****  people of orphalese, beauty is life when life unveils her holy face.  but you are life you are veil. beauty is eternity gazing at itself in mirror.  but you are eternity you are the mirror.  ***** *****  and old priest said, speak to us of _religion_.  and he said:  have i spoken this day of aught else?  is not religion all deeds all reflection,  and that which is neither deed nor reflection, but wonder surprise ever springing in soul, even while the hands hew stone or tend the loom?  who can separate his faith from his actions, or his belief from his occupations?  who can spread his hours before him, saving, “this for god this for myself; this for my soul, this other for my body?”  all your hours are wings that beat through space from self to self. he who wears his morality but as his best garment were better naked.  the wind sun will tear no holes in his skin.  and he who defines his conduct by ethics imprisons his song-bird in cage.  the freest song comes not through bars and wires.  and he to whom worshipping is window, to open but also to shut, has not yet visited house of his soul whose windows are from dawn to dawn.  *****  your daily life is your temple your religion.  whenever you enter into it take with you your all.  take plough forge the mallet lute,  the things you have fashioned in necessity or for delight.  for in revery you cannot rise above your achievements nor fall lower than your failures.  and take with you all men: for in adoration you cannot fly higher than their hopes nor humble yourself lower than their despair.  *****  and if you would know god be not therefore solver of riddles.  rather look about you you shall see him playing with your children.  and look into space; you shall see him walking in cloud, outstretching his arms in lightning descending in rain.  you shall see him smiling in flowers, then rising waving his hands in trees.  ***** *****  then almitra spoke, saying, we would ask now of _death_.  and he said:  you would know secret of death.  but how shall you find it unless you seek it in heart of life?  the owl whose night-bound eyes are blind unto day cannot unveil mystery of light.  if you would indeed behold spirit of death, open your heart wide unto the body of life.  for life death are one, even as the river sea are one.  in depth of your hopes desires lies your silent knowledge of the beyond;  and like seeds dreaming beneath snow your heart dreams of spring.  trust dreams, for in them is hidden the gate to eternity. your fear of death is but trembling of the shepherd when he stands before king whose hand is to be laid upon him in honour.  is shepherd not joyful beneath his trembling, that he shall wear mark of king?  yet is he not more mindful of his trembling?  *****  for what is it to die but to stand naked in wind to melt into sun?  and what is it to cease breathing, but to free breath from its restless tides, that it may rise expand and seek god unencumbered?  only when you drink from river of silence shall you indeed sing.  and when you have reached mountain top, then you shall begin to climb.  and when earth shall claim your limbs, then shall you truly dance. and now it was evening.  and almitra seeress said, blessed be this day this place your spirit that has spoken.  and he answered, was it i who spoke? was i not also listener?  *****  then he descended steps of the temple all people followed him. and he reached his ship stood upon the deck.  and facing people again, he raised his voice said:  people of orphalese, wind bids me leave you.  less hasty am i than wind, yet i must go.  we wanderers, ever seeking lonelier way, begin no day where we have ended another day; no sunrise finds us where sunset left us. even while the earth sleeps we travel.  we are seeds of tenacious plant, it is in our ripeness our fullness of heart that we are given to the wind are scattered.  *****  brief were my days among you, and briefer still words i have spoken.  but should my voice fade in your ears, and my love vanish in your memory, then i will come again,  and with richer heart lips more yielding to spirit will i speak.  yea, i shall return with tide,  and though death may hide me, the greater silence enfold me, yet again will i seek your understanding.  and not in vain will i seek.  if aught i have said is truth, that truth shall reveal itself in clearer voice, in words more kin to your thoughts.  i go with wind, people of orphalese, but not down into emptiness; and if this day is not fulfilment of your needs my love, then let it be promise till another day.  man’s needs change, but not his love, nor his desire that his love should satisfy his needs.  know therefore, that from greater silence i shall return.  the mist that drifts away at dawn, leaving but dew in fields, shall rise gather into cloud then fall down in rain.  and not unlike mist have i been.  in stillness of night i have walked in your streets, my spirit has entered your houses,  and your heart-beats were in my heart, and your breath was upon my face, i knew you all.  ay, i knew your joy your pain, and in your sleep your dreams were my dreams.  and oftentimes i was among you lake among mountains.  i mirrored summits in you the bending slopes, even the passing flocks of your thoughts your desires.  and to my silence came laughter of your children in streams, the longing of your youths in rivers.  and when they reached my depth the streams rivers ceased not yet to sing.  [illustration: 0119]  but sweeter still than laughter and greater than longing came to me.  it was boundless in you;  the vast man in whom you are all but cells sinews;  he in whose chant all your singing is but soundless throbbing.  it is in vast man that you are vast,  and in beholding him that i beheld you and loved you.  for what distances can love reach that are not in that vast sphere?  what visions, what expectations what presumptions can outsoar that flight?  like giant oak tree covered with apple blossoms is vast man in you. his might binds you to earth, his fragrance lifts you into space, in his durability you are deathless.  *****  you have been told that, even like a chain, you are as weak as your weakest link.  this is but half truth. you are also as strong as your strongest link.  to measure you by your smallest deed is to reckon power of ocean by the frailty of its foam.  to judge you by your failures is to cast blame upon seasons for their inconstancy.  ay, you are like ocean,  and though heavy-grounded ships await the tide upon your shores, yet, even like ocean, you cannot hasten your tides.  and like seasons you are also,  and though in your winter you deny your spring,  yet spring, reposing within you, smiles in her drowsiness is not offended. think not i say these things in order that you may say one to the other, “he praised us well. he saw but the good in us.”  i only speak to you in words of that which you yourselves know in thought.  and what is word knowledge but shadow of wordless knowledge?  your thoughts my words are waves from sealed memory that keeps records of our yesterdays,  and of ancient days when earth knew not us nor herself,  and of nights when earth was up-wrought with confusion.  *****  wise men have come to you to give you of their wisdom. i came to take of your wisdom:  and behold i have found that which is greater than wisdom.  it is flame spirit in you ever gathering more of itself,  while you, heedless of its expansion, bewail withering of your days. it is life in quest of life in bodies that fear grave.  *****  there are no graves here.  these mountains plains are cradle and stepping-stone.  whenever you pass by field where you have laid your ancestors look well thereupon, you shall see yourselves and your children dancing hand in hand.  verily you often make merry without knowing.  others have come to you to whom for golden promises made unto your faith you have given but riches power and glory.  less than promise have i given, and yet more generous have you been to me.  you have given me my deeper thirsting after life.  surely there is no greater gift to man than that which turns all his aims into parching lips all life into a fountain.  [illustration: 0125]  and in this lies my honour my reward,--  that whenever i come to fountain to drink i find living water itself thirsty;  and it drinks me while i drink it.  *****  some of you have deemed me proud and over-shy to receive gifts.  too proud indeed am i to receive wages, but not gifts.  and though i have eaten berries among the hills when you would have had me sit at your board,  and slept in portico of temple when you would gladly have sheltered me,  yet was it not your loving mindfulness of my days my nights that made food sweet to my mouth girdled my sleep with visions?  for this i bless you most:  you give much know not that you give at all. verily kindness that gazes upon itself in mirror turns to stone,  and good deed that calls itself by tender names becomes parent to a curse.  *****  and some of you have called me aloof, and drunk with my own aloneness,  and you have said, “he holds council with trees of forest, but not with men.  he sits alone on hill-tops looks down upon our city.”  true it is that i have climbed hills and walked in remote places.  how could i have seen you save from a great height or great distance?  how can one be indeed near unless he be tar?  and others among you called unto me, not in words, they said,  “stranger, stranger, lover of unreachable heights, why dwell you among the summits where eagles build their nests? why seek you the unattainable?  what storms would you trap in your net,  and what vaporous birds do you hunt in the sky?  come be one of us.  descend appease your hunger with our bread quench your thirst with our wine.”  in solitude of their souls they said these things;  but were their solitude deeper they would have known that i sought but the secret of your joy your pain,  and i hunted only your larger selves that walk sky.  *****  but hunter was also hunted;  for many of my arrows left my bow only to seek my own breast.  and flier was also creeper;  for when my wings were spread in the sun their shadow upon earth was a turtle.  and i believer was also doubter; for often have i put my finger in my own wound that i might have the greater belief in you greater knowledge of you.  *****  and it is with this belief this knowledge that i say,  you are not enclosed within your bodies, nor confined to houses or fields.  that which is you dwells above the mountain roves with wind.  it is not thing that crawls into the sun for warmth or digs holes into darkness for safety,  but thing free, spirit that envelops the earth moves in ether.  if these be vague words, then seek not to clear them.  vague nebulous is beginning of all things, but not their end,  and i fain would have you remember me as a beginning.  life, all that lives, is conceived in mist not in crystal. and who knows but crystal is mist in decay?  *****  this would i have you remember in remembering me:  that which seems most feeble and bewildered in you is strongest and most determined.  is it not your breath that has erected and hardened structure of your bones?  and is it not dream which none of you remember having dreamt, that builded your city fashioned all there is in it?  could you but see tides of that breath you would cease to see all else,  and if you could hear whispering of the dream you would hear no other sound.  but you do not see, nor do you hear, and it is well.  the veil that clouds your eyes shall be lifted by hands that wove it,  and clay that fills your ears shall be pierced by those fingers that kneaded it. you shall see.  and you shall hear.  yet you shall not deplore having known blindness, nor regret having been deaf.  for in that day you shall know the hidden purposes in all things,  and you shall bless darkness as you would bless light.  after saying these things he looked about him, he saw pilot of his ship standing by helm gazing now at full sails now at the distance.  and he said:  patient, over patient, is captain of my ship.  the wind blows, restless are the sails;  even rudder begs direction;  yet quietly my captain awaits my silence.  and these my mariners, who have heard the choir of greater sea, they too have heard me patiently. now they shall wait no longer.  i am ready.  the stream has reached sea, and once more great mother holds her son against her breast.  *****  fare you well, people of orphalese.  this day has ended.  it is closing upon us even as the water-lily upon its own tomorrow.  what was given us here we shall keep,  and if it suffices not, then again must we come together together stretch our hands unto giver.  forget not that i shall come back to you.  a little while, my longing shall gather dust foam for another body.  a little while, moment of rest upon the wind, another woman shall bear me.  farewell to you youth i have spent with you.  it was but yesterday we met in a dream. you have sung to me in my aloneness, i of your longings have built tower in sky.  but now our sleep has fled our dream is over, it is no longer dawn.  the noontide is upon us our half waking has turned to fuller day, we must part.  if in twilight of memory we should meet once more, we shall speak again together you shall sing to me a deeper song.  and if our hands should meet in another dream we shall build another tower in the sky.  *****  so saying he made signal to the seamen, straightway they weighed anchor cast ship loose from its moorings, they moved eastward.  and cry came from people as from a single heart, it rose into dusk and was carried out over sea like a great trumpeting.  only almitra was silent, gazing after the ship until it had vanished into the mist.  and when all people were dispersed she still stood alone upon sea-wall, remembering in her heart his saying,  “a little while, moment of rest upon the wind, another woman shall bear me.”  [illustration: 0134]         end of project gutenberg ebook of prophet, by kahlil gibran  *** end of this project gutenberg ebook prophet ***  *****
